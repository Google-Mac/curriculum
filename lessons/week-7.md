## Mentor Guided Learning
With your mentee complete the following:

* Create an addition function that adds 2 numbers together and returns the sum
* Create a subtraction function that subtracts a number from another number and returns the difference
* Create a multiplication function that returns the product
* Create a division function that returns the quotient of 2 numbers

* Create a small HTML, JS calculator where a user can select an operation against 2 inputs and receive the answer. 

## Assignment

## Extension
Work on using Javascript to update HTML elements on the DOM. We will learn more about this in future lessons. This is a common use case for Javascript. 

## Questions
What are the different datatypes found in native javascript?

## Mentor Guided Learning
With your mentee complete the following:
1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled Create.
1. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, use a factory function that creates a new DOM component that has a border, and includes it's own delete button.
1. Insert that new component into the DOM.
1. When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.


## Assignment

## Extension
Change your translator from usng a match string type of architecture (I believe you probably used this) -and implement [regular expressions](https://shiffman.net/a2z/regex/) 

## Questions
Now that you've made a some what complicated JS document, how best can you organize your code so that it is easy to come back and add new features?

## Instructions:
Before you start work on your assignment complete the following steps to get GitHub setup correctly. This is how you will share your work with your mentor and Code Apprentice.

1. Create a new repo in github titled `hangman`
1. Copy the url titled `quick setup` it should start with https:// This will be different for everyone and should should replace `{origin-from-your-github-repo}` with that link.
1. Open a terminal
1. Copy and paste the following commands into your terminal.
	- `cd ~ && mkdir workspace`

	- `git remote add origin {origin-from-your-github-repo}`
	- `git add .`
	- `git commit -m 'init commit'`
	- `git push origin master`

### Directions
1. Create a hangman game using html, css, and jQuery.
1. You should only worry about guessing 1 word.
1. The user should be able to enter in a letter.
1. If the letter is correct then it should be filed into the missing spot of the word.
1. If the answer is incorrect then the incorrect guess should be tallied into a different segment on the user interface.
1. Once the user guesses the word correct they win. Prompt the user that they won with a pop up.
1. If the user has 10 incorrect guesses prompt the user that they loss the game, with a pop up.
1. Be creative.
